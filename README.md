# Solving-Linear-Advection-equation-with-sinusoidal-IC-and-Periodic-BC.
Solving the Linear-Advection equation with sinusoidal I.C and periodic B.C using "upwind", "Lax", "Lax-Wendroff", "MacCormack" schemes.
The Advection equation is u_t + a*u_x = 0 and a=0.5 is wave speed.
Initial condition is u(x,0)=sin(4*pi*x) with periodic Boundary condition.
